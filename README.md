+ Game Objective
---
The goal is to accumulate mass. If your ship has sufficient mass, the asteroid will be absorbed; otherwise, the asteroid will take mass from you. «The game is over when your ship has no mass left»[__Not implemented__]. The ship can shoot lasers to break apart particularly heavy asteroids. Every round the asteroids become progressively heavier. Once your ship reaches 'critical mass', your task is to shoot any orbiting asteroids.
